## Project Motivation
This project ***Write a Data Science Blog Post*** is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

The objective of this project is to apply data transformation and Advanced Model training to further develop a Machine Learning model. The original dataset can be found here: <a href='https://www.properati.com.co'>Properati</a>

This project focuses on answering several questions such as:
- How large is the dataset? How many instances and how many columns?
- How many missing values are there in each column?
- How many property types are published according to this dataset?
- How many instances of each property type are there in the dataset? 
- What are the most expensive neighborhoods in and around Buenos Aires?
- What will be the best predictor variables for the variable of interest, i.e., the price of a property?
